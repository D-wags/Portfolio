      Namaste internet and welcome to my web page!  As you have likely deduced, my name is Drew Wagner.  I am an aspiring web developer, biochemist, and student of the world.  I have been a resident of Texas for 4 years, having moved to Austin in 2012 for a graduate program in biochemistry at UT. One nice feature of graduate school is that all grad students get free tuition and can take any class at UT, an oppurtunity that I take great advantage of.  In my exploitation of free education, I took several introductory computer science courses and, finding them interesting am now beginning to dive into web development.  It is my hope that this humble page will be the first of many as well as a stepping stone on my path to mastery of the stack. In addition to my bourgeoning coding skills, I am also a former pet owner. But these days the closest thing I have to an animal companion would probably be my basil plant, although I will soon be sacrificing it to the pesto gods.
